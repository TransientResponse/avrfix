# AVRFIX -- A fixed point math library for Arduino
Original authors: Maximilian Rosenblattl and Andreas Wolf
Their work may be found [here](http://avrfix.sourceforge.net/).

Their library was meant to be compiled as a static `.a` file. Arduino doesn't have the ability to include pre-built `.a` files as libraries. I am in the process of porting the code to be compatible with Arduino.

I am also fixing several bugs.
